Conducted user research through field studies and workshops to identify user needs and pain points, leading to valuable insights for decision-making. User journey maps were crafted based on research, providing a strategic roadmap for projects. Product features were defined to align with user expectations and business goals, ensuring an effective user experience throughout the development lifecycle. Usability testing sessions were planned and moderated to evaluate the product's support for users' daily tasks.

High-fidelity designs, prototypes, and user flows were created using Figma, with a robust design system established to maintain a consistent visual identity across all products.

Collaborated with software engineers and product owners to develop web applications using Next.js and TypeScript, integrating frontend development with strong UX/UI design principles.
