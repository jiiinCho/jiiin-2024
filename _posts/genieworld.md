An interactive, web-based platform built with React and TypeScript, the frontend includes pure CSS animations for smooth visuals, allowing users to customize their own virtual world.

The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures secure user authentication with JsonWebToken (JWT) and bcrypt encryption, with data stored in MongoDB. Deployed on Netlify and Heroku, the project offers a seamless user experience. Custom-designed graphics create a cohesive aesthetic, showcasing strong frontend development, creative design, and backend integration.
