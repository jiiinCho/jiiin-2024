Parametric design optimizes structural and material parameters to achieve the best performance while meeting design and manufacturing constraints.

Using C# scripts within the Grasshopper plugin for Rhino 3D, projects were developed to study shapes for maximizing sunlight, create production drawings for complex forms, and build BIM models. This method enhances precision and efficiency in design, improving both functionality and aesthetics in architecture and engineering.
