Published a component library for mobile applications based on the react-native-calendars library to address the need for simultaneous date marking with dots and periods.

The project involved learning how to publish to the npm registry, writing comprehensive documentation for consumers, refactoring date calculation logic, and implementing localization using date-fns internationalization.

Key features of the library include date marking for dots, periods, and blocked dates, localization support, accessibility features, and custom theming. This project demonstrates the ability to enhance existing tools, improve user experience, and contribute to the developer community.
